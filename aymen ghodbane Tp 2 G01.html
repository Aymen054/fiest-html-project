  <h1>Virtulization</h1>
  <p>
    In  computing. virtulization refers to the act of creating a virtual(rather than actual) version of something.
    This includes virtual computer hardware, virtual strage devices and virtual network resources.

      <h1>Levels of Virtulization</h1>
          <ol>
            <li><h4>Virtulization at Instruction Set Architecture(ISA)level</h4> </li>
              <p> Every machine has an instruction set This instruction set is an interface between softwarre and hardware Using this instruction software can communicate With hardware. </p>
              <li><h4>Virtulization at Operating System(O.S)level</h4></li>
            <p>In virtulization at HAL level cach virtual machine is built from scratch is by installing OS . application suites . networking systems.ete

          </ol>
          <ul><li>In clod somtimes , we need ro intialize 100 Virtual machines ar single time if we use virtualization at Hardware abstraction layer(HAL)level this can tacke much time  </li>
          <li> So to overcom this in Virtulization at Operation system level we char operating system between Virtual machine along with the hardare</li>
